# REG-072: Wallet run currency sinks and reward pacing

## Status
Done

## Priority
P1

## Area
Gameplay

## Evidence
- `tasks/refined-experience-gaps/README.md`
- `docs/reference-comparison/CURRENT_VS_ENDPRODUCT.md`
- `tasks/refined-experience-gaps/REG-033-bot-handoff-sequencing-and-dependency-map.md`
- `tasks/refined-experience-gaps/REG-015-shop-and-run-currency-system.md`
- `tasks/refined-experience-gaps/REG-024-economy-unification.md`
- `docs/gameplay-tasks/`
- `docs/new_design/TASKS/`

## Problem
Run **currency** in, **sinks** (shop, rest, services), and **reward pacing** per floor/act must be expressed as numbers or curves QA can test — not only narrative “you earn favor.” Imbalanced sinks block `REG-015` and `REG-086` (balance sim) from meaning anything.

## Target Experience
Relevant UI and data paths meet the **Choose Path or better** bar on phone and desktop, with trustable local saves. Competitive **online** leaderboards and mandatory **online** services remain **out of scope** for v1 per `REG-052` and the README refinement bar — local/offline first.

## Suggested Implementation
- Tie earn/spend to `RunState` and document conversion at run end; cross-link `REG-024` unification and `REG-086` baselines (`REG-141`).
- Sequence with `REG-033` and P0 economy gates from `REG-000` before broad meta sinks.
- Optional **offline** playtest capture per `REG-030` / `REG-124` — not server aggregates.

## Acceptance Criteria
- This document’s scope is resolvable as one or more implementation PRs with clear verification, without requiring final licensed assets in this pass.
- Links to related REG tasks are present and the overlap with `REG-015`–`REG-021`, `REG-040`–`REG-043`, and `REG-052` is acknowledged where relevant.
- The **Placeholder and asset contract (placeholderNeeded)** section states either **Not applicable** or required slots and fallbacks.

## Verification
- File includes: Status, Priority, Area, Evidence, Problem, Target Experience, Suggested Implementation, Acceptance Criteria, Verification, **Placeholder and asset contract (placeholderNeeded)**, and **Cross-links**.
- `git status --short` for implementation work is scoped and reviewable.
- No schema change is *required* by this markdown-only definition; implementation work follows separately.

## Placeholder and asset contract (placeholderNeeded)
- **Not applicable** for shippable new art, audio, trailer, capsule, or poster deliverables in this task’s planning scope. If implementation implies UI, use existing in-product frames, procedural audio fallbacks, and placeholder copy per `REG-113` until owners supply finals. The implementation bot does not generate or license final marketing art.
