# REG-089: Final rules versioning and save migration gate

## Status
Done

## Priority
P0

## Area
Systems

## Evidence
- `tasks/refined-experience-gaps/README.md`
- `docs/reference-comparison/CURRENT_VS_ENDPRODUCT.md`
- `tasks/refined-experience-gaps/REG-033-bot-handoff-sequencing-and-dependency-map.md`
- `tasks/refined-experience-gaps/REG-015-shop-and-run-currency-system.md`
- `tasks/refined-experience-gaps/REG-024-economy-unification.md`
- `docs/gameplay-tasks/`
- `docs/new_design/TASKS/`

## Problem
**`GAME_RULES_VERSION`**, **`SAVE_SCHEMA_VERSION`**, and **migration** policy need a **gate** the team runs before ship: when to bump, how players recover, and how bots validate (`REG-058`, `REG-139`). This is the **policy** hub for “we changed rules again.”

## Target Experience
Relevant UI and data paths meet the **Choose Path or better** bar on phone and desktop, with trustable local saves. Competitive **online** leaderboards and mandatory **online** services remain **out of scope** for v1 per `REG-052` and the README refinement bar — local/offline first.

## Suggested Implementation
- Link migration code paths in `normalizeSaveData`, tests, and `REG-040` / `REG-117` for backup/restore story.
- Cross-link `REG-083` dailies and `REG-023` for clock/identity; **no online** version authority in v1.

## Acceptance Criteria
- This document’s scope is resolvable as one or more implementation PRs with clear verification, without requiring final licensed assets in this pass.
- Links to related REG tasks are present and the overlap with `REG-015`–`REG-021`, `REG-040`–`REG-043`, and `REG-052` is acknowledged where relevant.
- The **Placeholder and asset contract (placeholderNeeded)** section states either **Not applicable** or required slots and fallbacks.

## Verification
- File includes: Status, Priority, Area, Evidence, Problem, Target Experience, Suggested Implementation, Acceptance Criteria, Verification, **Placeholder and asset contract (placeholderNeeded)**, and **Cross-links**.
- `git status --short` for implementation work is scoped and reviewable.
- No schema change is *required* by this markdown-only definition; implementation work follows separately.

## Placeholder and asset contract (placeholderNeeded)
- **Not applicable** for shippable new art, audio, trailer, capsule, or poster deliverables in this task’s planning scope. If implementation implies UI, use existing in-product frames, procedural audio fallbacks, and placeholder copy per `REG-113` until owners supply finals. The implementation bot does not generate or license final marketing art.
