## Problem
Repeat rate, modifier chords, and low-level ghosting on laptop keyboards can break power shortcuts and pause — `REG-029` depth. **Enterprise depth wave:** this ticket adds explicit combinatoric, process, and edge coverage that large teams use so gaps are not left only in `GP-*` or implicit QA habit.

## Target Experience
Engineering and QA can **name** a matrix, a gate, or an edge list; long-running implementation work can verify against it without re-deriving risk from scratch. **Online** services are **out of scope** for v1 per `REG-052` and `README` — these tasks are **local/offline**-first, Steam-client-only where relevant (`REG-137`).

**Focus:** Hardware matrix, OS settings, and game-level debounce policy.

## Suggested Implementation
- Cross-link `REG-041` (replay), `REG-040` / `REG-117` (save), `REG-119` (acceptance), `REG-087` (softlock suite index), and `REG-086` / `REG-030` as applicable; avoid duplicating full bodies from `docs/gameplay/`.
- Name contract surfaces: `RunState`, `SaveData`, `Settings`, `GAME_RULES_VERSION`, `SAVE_SCHEMA_VERSION`, `FLOOR_SCHEDULE_RULES_VERSION`, `RelicId`, `MutatorId`, `FindableKind` only where the ticket’s scope needs it.
- Sequence with `REG-033` and P0 `REG-068` / `REG-087` when choosing batch order; fourth-wave P0s often support RC (`REG-130`) and combinatoric coverage (`REG-120`).

## Acceptance Criteria
- The ticket’s **Problem** and **Target** are unambiguous to a new engineer; cross-links to prior REGs are present.
- **Online** is not a shipping dependency for v1; Steam-only cases stay client/offline in `REG-137`.
- **Placeholder and asset contract (placeholderNeeded)** is filled (Not applicable or legal/store slots for `REG-137`).

## Verification
- File includes: Status, Priority, Area, Evidence, Problem, Target Experience, Suggested Implementation, Acceptance Criteria, Verification, **Placeholder and asset contract (placeholderNeeded)**, and **Cross-links**.
- `git status --short` for implementation is scoped; markdown-only in this pass for new files.

## Placeholder and asset contract (placeholderNeeded)
- **Not applicable** for shippable new art, audio, trailer, capsule, or poster deliverables in this task’s planning scope. If implementation implies UI, use existing in-product frames, procedural audio fallbacks, and placeholder copy per `REG-113` until owners supply finals. The implementation bot does not generate or license final marketing art.
