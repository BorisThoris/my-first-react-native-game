# REG-102: Responsive layout final device grid

## Status
Done

## Priority
P0

## Area
UI

## Evidence
- `tasks/refined-experience-gaps/README.md`
- `docs/reference-comparison/CURRENT_VS_ENDPRODUCT.md`
- `tasks/refined-experience-gaps/REG-033-bot-handoff-sequencing-and-dependency-map.md`
- `tasks/refined-experience-gaps/REG-015-shop-and-run-currency-system.md`
- `tasks/refined-experience-gaps/REG-024-economy-unification.md`
- `docs/gameplay-tasks/`
- `docs/new_design/TASKS/`

## Problem
Final **responsive** **device grid** and breakpoint behavior so **every** `REG-090`+ screen holds layout on short viewports — the technical backbone for **mobile in-scope** in `README` and `REG-028`.

## Target Experience
Relevant UI and data paths meet the **Choose Path or better** bar on phone and desktop, with trustable local saves. Competitive **online** leaderboards and mandatory **online** services remain **out of scope** for v1 per `REG-052` and the README refinement bar — local/offline first.

## Suggested Implementation
- Tie to CSS / layout in `src/renderer` and `REG-003` / `REG-031` rails; `REG-006` / `REG-028` for touch targets; **no** online requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria
- This document’s scope is resolvable as one or more implementation PRs with clear verification, without requiring final licensed assets in this pass.
- Links to related REG tasks are present and the overlap with `REG-015`–`REG-021`, `REG-040`–`REG-043`, and `REG-052` is acknowledged where relevant.
- The **Placeholder and asset contract (placeholderNeeded)** section states either **Not applicable** or required slots and fallbacks.

## Verification
- File includes: Status, Priority, Area, Evidence, Problem, Target Experience, Suggested Implementation, Acceptance Criteria, Verification, **Placeholder and asset contract (placeholderNeeded)**, and **Cross-links**.
- `git status --short` for implementation work is scoped and reviewable.
- No schema change is *required* by this markdown-only definition; implementation work follows separately.

## Placeholder and asset contract (placeholderNeeded)
- **Slots (planning):** list icon sizes, key art, audio stingers, and store media required for ship quality.
- **Fallbacks (allowed):** reuse existing in-game frames, `silence` / procedural SFX, solid panels, and placeholder copy.
- **Bot constraint:** the implementation agent must not generate or license final shippable art, audio, or legal text; it wires placeholders and documents acceptance slots only.
