# Epic: Board rendering & assists

## Scope

How the board is shown (WebGL), optional player assists, and mutator-adjacent **presentation** (things meant to change how cards are read, not just score).

## Implementation status

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Tile board (R3F / Three) | **Shippable** | `TileBoardScene.tsx` — cards, rims, matched flame, pick mesh, etc. |
| Shifting spotlight (ward/bounty) | **Shippable** | Props from `GameScreen` → `TileBoard` → `TileBoardScene`; corner/edge highlights for ward and bounty on relevant faces. |
| Findables (`findables_floor`) | **Shippable** | `findableKind` drives corner ring + HUD strings; scoring in `game.ts`. |
| Pair distance hints | **Shippable** (new) | `pairProximityHint.ts`, `PairProximityHintPlane.tsx`; setting `pairProximityHintsEnabled`; Manhattan distance to nearest legal pair partner; decoys show no badge. |
| Focus assist | **Functional** | Setting `tileFocusAssist`; `focusDimmedTileIds` / dimming in scene — paired with “fallback board” language in settings; WebGL path implements dimming when data provided. |
| `wide_recall` presentation | **Functional** | Rules: per-match score penalty. **Renderer:** `wideRecallInPlay` → `TileBoard` → `TileBoardScene`; flipped in-play faces use a **cooler tint** (`presentationWideRecall`) — not a separate symbol mesh. |
| `silhouette_twist` presentation | **Functional** | Same path; **darker silhouette-style** face read (`presentationSilhouette`) on flipped tiles in play. |
| `n_back_anchor` on-board cue | **Functional** | `nBackAnchorPairKey` + `nBackMutatorActive` forwarded; **cyan anchor emphasis** on the anchor pair’s flipped tiles (`presentationNBackAnchor`). HUD subline may still add context. |
| Keyboard focus ring | **Shippable** | Gated to board `role="application"` DOM focus so one tile does not look permanently focused. |
| Distraction channel | **Functional** | Score penalty + optional HUD overlay when mutator active and user enables `distractionChannelEnabled` and motion allows. |

## Rough edges

- **Presentation mutators:** Penalties in sim; WebGL uses **material/tint** treatments for the three headline presentation mutators — tune vs product mockups if art direction tightens.
- **Single source of truth:** When adding `TileBoard` props, forward or intentionally omit in `TileBoardScene` (see polish backlog audit row).

## Primary code

- `src/renderer/components/TileBoardScene.tsx`, `TileBoard.tsx`, `GameScreen.tsx`
- `src/shared/pairProximityHint.ts`, `src/renderer/components/PairProximityHintPlane.tsx`
- `src/shared/focusDimmedTileIds.ts`
- `game.ts` — `getPresentationMutatorMatchPenalty`

## Refinement

**Shippable** for board fidelity, spotlight/findables, and baseline **3D presentation** for `wide_recall` / `silhouette_twist` / `n_back_anchor`. Further art-pass parity is optional.

## Tasks (polish backlog)

Tracked in rollup: [GAMEPLAY_POLISH_AND_GAPS.md](./GAMEPLAY_POLISH_AND_GAPS.md) §1.

- [x] Forward `wideRecallInPlay` from `TileBoard` to `TileBoardScene` and implement 3D legibility (label/symbol emphasis) per design, **or** document intentional deferral in catalog + this epic.
- [x] Forward silhouette / presentation state for `silhouette_twist` into `TileBoardScene` (materials/shader/CSS parity with DOM path).
- [x] Forward `nBackAnchorPairKey` and `nBackMutatorActive` into `TileBoardScene`; add WebGL anchor highlight or ring (not HUD-only).
- [x] Audit every `TileBoard` → `TileBoardScene` prop: **wire** presentation mutator data or **remove** unused/discarded props so QA does not assume 3D parity.
- [ ] (Optional) Add or extend Playwright coverage for presentation-mutator board paths once visuals are implemented.
