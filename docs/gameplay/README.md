# Gameplay documentation

## Authoritative catalog (complete coverage)

**[GAMEPLAY_MECHANICS_CATALOG.md](./GAMEPLAY_MECHANICS_CATALOG.md)** is the **full matrix** of gameplay mechanics: every major rule cluster, store actions, settings that affect play, input channels, and read-only UI. **§14 + Appendices A–D** list **every field** on `RunState`, `RunTimerState`, `SessionStats`, `BoardState`, and **`Tile`** from `src/shared/contracts.ts`. **Start here** to verify nothing is missing.

**[GAMEPLAY_POLISH_AND_GAPS.md](./GAMEPLAY_POLISH_AND_GAPS.md)** is the **rollup** of polish needs, partial implementations, and doc/UX risks—synthesized from each epic’s refinement notes (not a second source of truth).

Epics below are **narrative deep dives** + refinement notes; they must stay consistent with the catalog when mechanics change.

## How each doc is structured

- **Scope** — intent.
- **Implementation status** — shippable / functional / partial.
- **Rough edges** — stubs, drift, risks.
- **Primary code** — files to read.

**Refinement legend:**

| Level | Meaning |
|-------|--------|
| **Shippable** | Rules + feedback loop complete for typical players. |
| **Functional** | Core works; polish or edge cases incomplete. |
| **Partial** | Stub, hidden feature, or divergence from copy. |
| **Risky** | Comment/code mismatch or easy to misuse. |

## Maintenance

1. Change **[GAMEPLAY_MECHANICS_CATALOG](./GAMEPLAY_MECHANICS_CATALOG.md)** when adding or removing a mechanic.
2. Update the relevant **epic** (or add one if the catalog gains a new section).
3. Adjust **[GAMEPLAY_POLISH_AND_GAPS](./GAMEPLAY_POLISH_AND_GAPS.md)** when a polish gap closes or a new one appears (keep it a rollup, not a duplicate catalog).
4. Update the relevant epic’s **## Tasks (polish backlog)** checkboxes when work ships; add new tasks there first, then reflect in the polish doc if needed.
5. Keep this **README** index in sync.
