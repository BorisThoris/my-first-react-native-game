| REG-038 | 4 | done | Music loop state derives menu calm/run focus/pressure/release/silent layers from view/run/hidden state, pauses on meta/pause/game-over, and keeps adaptive intensity observation-only with existing music volume settings. | gameplayMusic tests |
| REG-051 | 4 | done | Social layer decision is share-only/offline for v1: no pass-and-play fields are persisted, online challenges remain REG-052-deferred, and Choose Path copy explicitly states local/share-string scope. | social-play-scope + ChoosePath tests |
| REG-053 | 4 | done | Daily streaks use friendly UTC rules with no freeze bank in v1, missed-day reset copy avoids shame/pressure, rewards are cosmetic/profile-only, and menu/Choose Path explain reset timing and non-punitive behavior. | daily-archive + save-data + menu/ChoosePath tests |
| REG-054 | 4 | done | Economy stance is premium/offline-first: ads/IAP/subscriptions/pay-to-win are prohibited, core fairness/accessibility/powers are never monetized, shop gold remains a run system, and future monetization requires a separate product decision. | premium-economy-policy + Settings tests |
| REG-055 | 4 | done | Localization foundation records English-only v1, future react-i18next preference, stable copy owners/surface ids, no non-English UI promise, and guardrails against large new inline component copy. | localization-readiness + mechanics tests |

| REG-064 | 4 | done | Mechanics glossary locks preferred labels and avoided terms for lives, guard tokens, combo shards, relic Favor, shop gold, relics, mutators, contracts, findables, and Perfect Memory; encyclopedia version and appendix are updated. | mechanics encyclopedia + appendix tests |
| REG-067 | 4 | done | Device motion polish is optional and user-initiated on touch devices, reduced motion hides/suppresses motion CTAs, unsupported platforms degrade silently, and haptics remain non-essential no-op polish in v1. | platformTilt permission/motion tests |
| REG-090 | 4 | done | Choose Path quality rollout is defined as a machine-readable screen-quality contract with per-screen rollout order, dependencies, placeholder/asset slots, offline/leaderboard scope, and verification routing for REG-091+. | REG_090_CHOOSE_PATH_QUALITY_ROLLOUT.md + JSON parse |
| REG-091 | 4 | done | Hub quality rows (mode entry, profile summary, return loop, trust boundary) remain defined from real save/run data via `getMainMenuHubQualityRows`; player-facing copy and stats live on **Profile**, while the main menu stays decluttered with a Profile entry and no fake social affordances. | main-menu-hub-quality.test + ProfileScreen.test + MainMenu tests |
| REG-092 | 4 | done | Settings acts as a control center with live control count, honest reference placeholders, profile trust, and mobile reachability rows surfaced above categories while Settings fields remain locally persisted and mapped. | settings-control-center + Settings tests |
| REG-093 | 4 | done | Collection has a final reward-gallery surface with owned, in-progress, and missing rows derived from local save achievements, profile goals, cosmetics, relic discovery, and run history, with honest local-only empty states. | collection-reward-gallery + Collection tests |

| REG-096 | 4 | done | Game Over surfaces a next-run loop with run-it-back, build recap, local share, and next-goal rows derived from local summary/run data, keeping Play Again/Main Menu above fold and no online ranking. | game-over-next-run + GameOver tests |
| REG-097 | 4 | done | Overlay decision sheets expose policy for alert/decision/sheet kinds with sticky one-hand action rails, keyboard/focus contracts, existing chrome, and no final licensed asset requirement. | overlay-decision-policy + OverlayModal tests |
| REG-098 | 4 | done | Main Menu help center replaces wall-of-text onboarding with skippable/replayable guided beats, points deeper help to Codex/Collection, and preserves gameplay first-run prompts from REG-026. | first-run-help-center + MainMenu/App tests |
| REG-099 | 4 | done | Navigation shell chrome/backstack invariants are machine-readable: page Back routes to menu, in-run meta preserves GameScreen, null-run recovery normalizes to menu, and game-over return stays local. | navigationModel + useAppStore tests |
| REG-100 | 4 | done | Empty/loading/error/locked state copy is centralized, actionable, local/offline-safe, and used by Inventory/Codex for no-run, no-relic, no-mutator, no-contract, and no-filter-result states. | ui-state-copy + Inventory/Codex tests |
| REG-101 | 4 | done | Copy tone rules align player-facing microcopy with mechanics glossary, premium/offline economy language, local scope, and concise mobile wording; shop buttons use “Spend shop gold” rather than real-money verbs. | copy-tone + mechanics/GameScreen tests |
| REG-102 | 4 | done | Responsive final device grid covers high-traffic shell screens across phone, tablet, short desktop, and desktop viewports with primary selectors, no-horizontal-scroll expectations, and layout summary helpers. | breakpoints/viewport matrix tests |
