# Visual System Spec

## Purpose
This document defines the shared art-direction system that the redesign should implement once and reuse across screens.

## Design Intent
The target is premium fantasy UI with cinematic dungeon atmosphere. The UI should feel forged, framed, and illuminated, not flat or generic.

Key goals:
- Environment-first presentation
- Premium materials and depth
- High-contrast state feedback
- Cohesive cross-screen chrome
- Strong hierarchy between hero content and support information

## Palette

### Core Tokens
| Token | Role | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Void Black | Root background and deepest shadow | Near-black charcoal rather than pure black |
| Smoke Blue | Cool support neutral | Used behind cards and chrome |
| Antique Gold | Premium structure and key highlights | Main frame and title accent |
| Brass Bronze | Secondary frame tone | Use where gold must not dominate |
| Ember Orange | Torchlight and danger warmth | Good for play CTA and firelit edges |
| Blood Red | Failure and heart/life emphasis | Use sparingly, mostly semantic |
| Arcane Violet | Daily, relic, mutator, magical content | Also used for featured mode cards |
| Success Green | Match and completion feedback | Reserve for positive state language |
| Parchment Ivory | Primary readable highlight text | For titles, labels, and selected copy |
| Dust Gray | Secondary utility copy | For subtitles and descriptions |

### Semantic Color Rules
- Gold frames structure and premium affordance.
- Violet marks magical or challenge content.
- Green marks success and resolved correctness.
- Red marks failure, loss, or life depletion.
- Orange belongs to warmth, intensity, and firelight.
- Blue-black is a support neutral, not a focus color.

### Color Discipline
- Never use green and red as ambient decoration. Keep them semantic.
- Keep violet reserved enough that daily/challenge content still feels special.
- Let the environment handle broad color mood while the UI uses tighter accents.

## Typography

### Target Font Pairing
- Display: classical serif in the spirit of `Cinzel Bold`
- Utility/body: neutral sans in the spirit of `Inter Regular`

### Type Roles
| Role | Use |
|---|---|
| Display XL | Hero logo and marquee titles |
| Display L | Screen titles and mode titles |
| Display M | CTA labels and emphasized stat numerals |
| Label S | Uppercase labels above stats and controls |
| Body M | Standard descriptions and helper copy |
| Body S | Fine print, metadata, and subtitles |

### Typography Rules
- Use uppercase or small-caps styling for labels, not long body copy.
- Large numerals deserve more contrast and spacing than adjacent labels.
- Body copy should stay restrained and readable. The display font should not bleed into utility text.

---

## Material Language

### Primary Materials
- Dark enamel or lacquer
- Aged brass and gold trim
- Worn iron or dark steel support edges
- Stone and dungeon masonry in backgrounds
- Smoky glass or haze for overlays
- Embossed leather-like card surfaces

### Surface Rules
- Panels should have both border definition and interior shading.
- Buttons should read as objects with rim, face, and shadow, not as flat pills.
- Card surfaces should carry texture and edge depth, not only color.
- Chrome should feel crafted, not sterile.

---

## Framing Motifs

### Ornamental Frame Language
- Fine border lines plus thicker outer silhouette
- Corner flourishes or notched edges
- Inner highlight near top edge
- Soft glow or bloom, especially on highlighted elements

### Where to Use Frames
- Main buttons
- HUD segments
- Settings shell
- Info cards
- Mode-selection cards
- Sidebar rails and medallions

### Where Not to Overuse Frames
- Long paragraphs of copy
- Dense data lists
- Invisible layout wrappers

---

## Lighting and Atmosphere

### Scene Lighting
- Background scenes should use diegetic light sources like torches, portals, candles, or magical crystals.
- Scene lighting should frame the primary CTA or gameplay board.
- Vignettes should isolate the focal content without flattening the art.

### UI Lighting
- Use restrained bloom on active, featured, or magical elements.
- Hover and focus should feel luminous, not simply enlarged.
- Use inner highlights to give surfaces depth.

---

## Iconography

### Icon Style
- Filled, engraved, or sculpted icons instead of thin generic line icons
- Icons live inside framed capsules or medallions
- Icons should match the fantasy prop language

### Semantic Icon Categories
- Progression: hearts, crests, shards, coins
- Utility: settings, messages, lore/book
- Navigation: pause, back, close
- Inventory/meta: bag, codex, collection

---

## Spacing and Radius

### Spacing Principles
- Preserve generous breathing room around hero elements.
- Separate hero content from metadata.
- Avoid crowding the board or main CTA stack with small support panels.

### Radius Principles
- Hero buttons and panels can be slightly sharper and more beveled than the current rounded system.
- Tiny circular or medallion treatments are preferred for icon capsules.
- Large shells should use restrained corner rounding so they still feel architectural.

---

## Motion Tone
- Weighty, slightly ceremonial, and magical
- Directional rather than floaty
- Prefer glow, tilt, reveal, and particle payoff over generic scaling
- Failure should feel sharp and brief
- Success should feel luminous and rewarding

Reduced-motion rules are specified in `MOTION_AND_STATE_SPEC.md`.

---

## Responsive Design Rules

### Desktop Priority
The references are clearly desktop-first. Desktop is the target composition standard.

### Tablet and Mobile Adaptation
- Preserve hierarchy before preserving exact geometry.
- Keep hero flow readable even when edge metadata compresses.
- Prefer collapsing secondary meta surfaces before collapsing the primary CTA or board readability.

### What Must Survive Compression
- Main CTA clarity
- Screen title legibility
- Board readability
- Sidebar or menu navigation affordance
- Modal readability

## Asset Dependencies
The target look cannot be reached with CSS polish alone. Required asset classes:
- painted or composited background scenes
- logo lockup or logo-support emblem
- premium card back art
- optional card face frames and overlays
- icon family
- display font files
- ornamental separators or frame assets where CSS/SVG alone is insufficient

Detailed asset handling lives in `ASSET_AND_ART_PIPELINE.md`.
